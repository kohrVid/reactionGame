# reactionGame

The reactionGame was first created back in April 2015 and based on the app demonstrated in [*The Complete Web Developer Course - Build 14 Websites*] series published by Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course).

Today I have made a change to the createdTime variable which should adjust the results so as to take into account the time delay before the shape is created.
